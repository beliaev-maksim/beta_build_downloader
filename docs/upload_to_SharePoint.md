Steps: 

1. Go to the `appregnew.aspx` page in your SharePoint Online site. 
For example, `https://ansys.sharepoint.com/sites/BetaDownloader/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`.
2. On this page, click the **Generate** buttons next to the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields to generate 
their values.
3. Store the client ID and client secret securely as these credentials can be used to read or update all data in your 
SharePoint Online environment. You will also use them to configure the SharePoint Online connection in application.
4. Under **Title**, specify a title. For example, `Python console`. Under **App Domain**, specify `localhost`. 
Under **Redirect URI**, specify `https://localhost`.

5. Click **Create**.

6. Go to the `appinv.aspx` page on the site collection to grant _site-scoped_ permissions.
`https://ansys.sharepoint.com/sites/BetaDownloader/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`

7. Specify your **client ID** in the **App Id** field and click Lookup to find your app.
To grant permissions to the app, copy the XML below to the Appâ€™s permission request XML field:

```
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
<AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection" Right="FullControl" />
</AppPermissionRequests>
```


8. Click **Create**.
9. On the confirmation dialog, click **Trust** It to grant the permissions.
