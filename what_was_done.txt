1. To download and install electron ( OS X or Linux ) you have to download it from npm-electron using :
npm install electron --save-dev
npm install -g electron

2. npm install python-shell

3. modified python-shell to make it run exe files, also I use a trick that I say path to python is my compile python_code.exe
and my script is null, then I commented lines in python-shell where check for script length occured

4. to run electron use in win shell:
electron .
